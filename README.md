<!-- ABOUT THE PRIVACY GUIDE -->
## About The User Guide

This guide aims to help the user understand how to use the Pirate Chain infastrucure to suit their privacy needs.

<!-- WHAT IS PIRATE CHAIN -->
## What is Pirate Chain?

Pirate Chain is a digital privacy currency created in August 29th 2018. The goal was simple: to create a completely anonymous cryptocurrency that is secure, untraceable and keep the identity of those who transact with it anonymous. Developers of various cryptocurrencies came together to create Pirate Chain to show the world that it’s not only possible, but also necessary. It has been proven by government agencies and chain analysts that Bitcoin, as well as all of the other “privacy” cryptocurrencies, can be traced and data can be taken from them in order to find out who uses these currencies, how much they spend and who they transact with. Pirate Chain, on the other hand, has none of these issues, as it uses military grade encryption and delayed proof of work to make it the most secure and anonymous cryptocurrency in the world!

Pirate Chain is a blockchain that uses [zero knowledge proofs](https://medium.com/@imolfar/why-and-how-zk-snark-works-1-introduction-the-medium-of-a-proof-d946e931160), by default, to prove and verify encrypted transactions.  This allows for Anonymous peer 2 peer transcations. 

## Why Pirate Chain?

Financial privacy has been constantly chipped away over the years, to a point where someone always knows how much money you have, what you spend it on, where you shop and so much more it makes you shudder just thinking about it. Even if you try to transact only in cash, you need a bank account to store it (unless you feel safe carrying all of your money with you, which is most likely not the case). Your right to privacy with these institutions is completely gone and your data is sold to the highest bidder. 

### Fungibility

Pirate Chains use of shielded transactions makes ARRR unique, it makes each ARRR fungible.  [Fungibility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibles.asp) is an important aspect of money that makes each unit indisstiguishable to each other, they are interchangable.  1 ARRR = 1 ARRR

### Scarcity

Having an infinte supply of a commodity, will have a negative impact on the demand.  [Scarcity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity.asp) is another important aspect that adds value to a commodity.  The supply of ARRR is capped at 200 Million, as of this article being written, over 97% of the supply has been mined, due to the accelerated emmsions schedual.

### Durability

Blockchains are nearly indestructable. All ARRR exists on the blockchain, copies of the blockchain are stored in Full Nodes

### Portability

Crypto is extremely portable, since the coins exist on the blockchain, access to it is as simple as 1) Having an internet connecion to allow you to install wallet software. 2) A device to install said software on. 3) Your spending keys.  With these 3 things you can access your coins.

### Recognizability

It took many years for Bitcoin to become know around the world.  The groundwork has been laid and only a matter of time before Pirate Chain is known for privacy as Bitcoin is know for being the first.

<!-- Privacy VS Anonymity VS Security -->
## Privacy VS Anonymity VS Security

The use of the word Privacy sometimes gets misunderstood, in the context of this guide, privacy is the combination of Privacy, Anonymity and Security in whatever meets the needs of the user. The analogy of writng a diary can illustrate this.

### What is Privacy?

PRIVACY is the quality or state of being apart from company or observation.

The contents of a diary are private when only you know.

### What is Anonymity?

ANONYMITY is the quality or state of being anonymous.

The contents of a diary can be known, but whom wrote the contents is not known.

### What is Security?

SECURITY is the quality or state of being secure.

The level of difficulty someone would need to overcome to access the contents of a diary.

<!-- Wallets -->
## Wallets

The term wallet is misguided, typically we think of a wallet as a place where we keep money.  Pirate Chain being a [UTXO](https://medium.com/cryptoapis/utxo-and-account-based-blockchains-d1d3c638524) based blockchain, all ARRR is associated with an address which is are unspent transctions.  A wallet is the access point to the blockchain, it holds your addresses and keys that are necassary to interact with the blockchain.  

Prior to downloading a wallet, there are some important aspects of using a wallet that need to be known, these are primarily for security.  

(VPN and FIREWALL) 

When creating a wallet a seed phrase is generated, that seed phrase is based off of [BIP39](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/list-of-bip39-wallets-mnemonic-seed).  It is extremely important to preserve this seed phrase.  This seed phrase will allow you to restore a wallet from newly installed software.  It also allows you to access addresses that are asociated to the wallet, into other wallets eg.(Full Node, Lite or Mobile wallet).  The seed phrase will not restore any addresses that were not generated by that wallet eg. imported addresses will not be restored.

Each address generated in your wallet will have a Spending Key or also known as a Private Key, this key allows you to spend ARRR.  Backing up your Private Key and keeping it secure is the most important thing to do. [How to Import and Export Private Keys](https://youtu.be/MmVR4QtjrU4).  You can import this key into any Pirate Chain wallet and access your ARRR.  To save all the spending keys in the wallet you can also save your wallet.dat file.

Each address generated in your wallet will have a Viewing Key, this allows you to view the UTXO(ARRR) associated with the address.  The viewing keys can only be imported into the Full node Wallet.  Viewing keys are only for viewing and give no access to the ARRR belonging to that address, these keys are safe to give out, if you have the need to prove ARRR associated with that address. [How to use Viewing Keys](https://youtu.be/IZUyjihAz04)



Pirate Chain has different wallets that you can use to access the blockchain.  Having a wallet is crucial in securing your ARRR.  You may have heard the term "Not your keys, not your coins", this means the unless you control the private keys of the address, you are not gaurenteed ownership.

### Lite Wallet

The fastest and simplest way to interact with the Pirate Chain blockchain.  The lite wallet accesses a server that has a copy of the blockchain hosted on it.  The lite wallet has some limitation compared to the Full Node wallet (ELABORATE ON DETAILS). The lite wallet offers the lowest level of privacy of all the wallets, using a VPN is suggested to increase the anonymity.  Running on a Linux based Operating System will also increase the security.

[Lite Wallet Tutorial](https://youtu.be/279QzgHU-wk)

### Full Node Wallet

The Full Node Wallet(Treasure Chest) is the most secure and recommended wallet to use, it will occupiy sbout 10GB od disk space. Installing a Full Node included a complete copy of the Pirate Chain blockchain from genesis block up to the current block.  This is done most effieciently through a process called bootstrapping.  Bootstrapping is a method of compressing the blockchain data and allowing the user to download and install the blocks and index.  Running a full node helps to strengthen the network by having multiple instances of the same blockchain available for confirmations.  The Full Node has the option of password protecting the wallet for an added level of security.  You can import viewkeys to the node to view the balances of addresses.  

[Download Full Node Wallet](https://pirate.black/wallets/treasure-chest/)

[Full Node Tutorial](https://youtu.be/qNV_uC2BHyg)

### Paper Wallet

The Paper Wallet is the most secure method of storing your ARRR.  This wallet allows you to generate an address and then you can export the spending key and the view key offline.  You can send your ARRR to this address and the spending key has never been exposed to a internet connection.  The viewkey can be imported to the Full Node wallet to see that your ARRR is at that address. 

[Download Paper Wallet](https://github.com/PirateNetwork/piratepaperwallet/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

[Paper Wallet Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zAIdQNhB6Z4)

### Mobile Wallet

The Mobile Wallet allows for use on Android and IoS(IOS 14.1+) devices with more that 3GB of RAM.  This wallet is the least secure and should be used with a VPN to maximize anonymity.  The covience and flexibilty of the mobile wallet is a nice addition to using a Full Node for on the go use.

### Hardware Wallet

The Pirate Hardware Wallet is the only device that is capable of processing zkSNARKs transactions, required by Pirate Chain (Arrr). Access to the unit is protected with a root-of-trust setup that starts in the boot ROM at power up, through all the boot phases, up to the pirate authenticator application. The small unit is portable, which offers convenience over the 2 PC online/offline split transaction capability in Treasure Chest. On the roadmap is to integrate the user interface with the smart phone Pirate wallets.

<!-- Aquiring ARRR -->
## Aquiring ARRR 

Once you have an address and the private keys secured you are in a good position to store ARRR that you plan to or have aquired.  There are different ways to aquire ARRR.

### Faucets

A faucet is a tool where a small amount of a coin is given out, normally used to allow users to test out and learn more about the blockchain and associated tools.  You can interact with a faucet at [Pirate Chain Discord](https://pirate.black/discord)

### Giveawys

Social Media platform users, use giveaways to help promote the project at time.  You can join [Social Media Platform](https://pirate.black/follow-us-on-social-media/) and watch for giveaways and try to meet the criteria and win ARRR

### Centralized Exchanges

The most common way of aquiring ARRR.  [Centralized Exchanges](https://pirate.black/exchanges/) that have trading pairs for ARRR, the typically trading pairs for ARRR are with BTC and USDT.  Some exchanges are on ramps for FIAT others only allow trading of crytpos.  Each exchange has their own rules and regualtion for the users, some afford more levels of anonymity than other.  CEX(Centralized Exchanges)  are not the most private, but one can avoid Excanges that use KYC(Know Your Customer) and AML(Anti Money Laundering).  

### Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized Exchanges(DEX) are more secure and typically safer and more anonymous due to being [non-custodial](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-crypto-wallets/). DEX's allow you to trade directly from your own wallet(addresses), always holding the private keys to your coins.  Most DEX's utilize a [Liquidity Pools](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-pools/) to allow for the transaction to be completed.  Typically DEX transactions are slower and more expensive, a trade off for more security and anonymity.

[Atomicdex](https://atomicdex.io/en/) is a DEX that is built by [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com/en/) which Pirate Chain is built on.  There is no Liquidity Pool involved in these swaps, they use special Timelock feature to either  allow for transaction to be made by two parties or return coins to owner due to a discrepancy in transactions.

### Over the Counter

The most Private and anonymous, yet may not be the most secure, is and over the counter exchange.  These exchanges involve two or three people(Three if an [Escrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp) is used).  Two parties must agree on an amount and a cost to trade a coin.  The downfall of these transactions is that more trust is involved and can be less secure.  To make this more safe, an Escrow service can be used, still trust must exist.  [Pirate Chain Discord](https://pirate.black/discord) has a channel #OTC, dedicated to help parties find trading partners.

### Mining

Mining is the process in which [Blocks](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/what-is-a-block-in-the-blockchain-c7a420270373) are mined, transactions are included in the blocks as well.  The reward for mining a block is a block reward, which is a predetermines amount.  Any fees that are associated with the transaction that have been included in these blocks also go to the finder of the blocks.  This process is done with special minig tools.  You can mine some ARRR with these tools.  [Pirate Chain](https://pirate.black/discord) has a channel #Mining, dedicated to mining questions.

### PirateLife Casino

If you have some ARRR and feel lucky you can try your luck at the [Piratelife Casino](https://piratelife.casino/) and try and win more ARRR

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
